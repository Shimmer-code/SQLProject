对COVID-19数据进行了全面分析，包括查看基础疫苗接种数据、计算各国感染后的死亡率、分析人口感染比例、统计各国家和地区的最高死亡人数以及按大洲分类的死亡数据，还使用CTE、临时表和视图三种方法计算并比较了全球疫苗接种进度与人口接种率。代码中通过类型转换和NULLIF处理确保了计算准确性，并通过分区计算实现了累计统计，为COVID-19疫情的感染、死亡和疫苗接种情况提供了多角度的数据洞察。

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, including reviewing basic vaccination information, calculating death rates after infection by country, analyzing the percentage of population infected, identifying the highest death counts across countries and regions, and examining death statistics by continent. Additionally, used CTEs, TEMP TABLE, and views to calculate and compare global vaccination progress and population vaccination rates. Type conversions and NULLIF were applied in the code to ensure calculation accuracy, and partitioned calculations were used to compute cumulative statistics. This project provides multi-angle data insights into COVID-19 infection, mortality, and vaccination trends.
